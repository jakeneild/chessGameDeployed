Thank you for checking out my chess app :)

My app is designed with vanilla JS.  To use this app, run a package install in SRC,
then run grunt in SRC.  You can then run the app from the dist folder.

As of now, the chessboard should be 100% working.

The AI is far from perfect, but it should be able to provide you with legal,
mostly good moves.  

The only global function calls are in main.js, so if you are trying to figure out
how everything works, that is the best place to start.

Much of the code is not elegantly written and could be written more efficiently.
This is the first time I've written an app like this.
